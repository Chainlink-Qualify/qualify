A blockchain Vetting Application for talents/applicants
User flow: 



User 1(Applicant)


User signs up on the platform, and completes KYC
User automatically creates an Ethereum wallet or links their wallet while completing the KYC process.
KYC process should include sections on personal details and work experiences (and achievements)
Work Experiences should include a field for the contact person of the jobs (preferably, the HR, or supervisor). Work email will be most preferred; in the absence of work email, phone numbers, or email would suffice.
 User should have access to their profile/dashboard, and also view their wallet.


User 2(Business)


User signs up on the platform, either with their email addresses, or Google/LinkedIn accounts
User searches for talents by name
If talent is present on the platform, the search engine brings up their data, else, it prompts the user to start a query (vetting process)
A modal pops up, or a query page opens up, where the user inputs the details in the provided fields - full name, previous work place (the one they want to vet), contact person for the job, achievements (optional).
User should have a dashboard. Features on the dashboard should include - my subscriptions, completed vettings, pending vettings.
Just like Gmail, when an outgoing mail, until it’s delivered, remains in the outbox, and when delivered, appears in the sent mail; pending vettings will show the vettings yet to be completed successfully, while completed vettings will contain all successfully completed vettings. When a new vetting is successfully completed, it’ll not only appear as a push notification, but show on the completed vettings as 1, or 2, or 3, etc. depending on the number of vets launched.
Once vetting is launched


User 3(Admin)


Admin monitors the activities of User 1 and User 2
